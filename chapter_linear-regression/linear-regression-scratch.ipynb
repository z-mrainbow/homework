        "In this section, we took a significant step\n",

        "by implementing a fully functional\n",
        "neural network model and training loop.\n",
        "In this process, we built a data loader,\n",
        "a model, a loss function, an optimization procedure,\n",
        "and a visualization and monitoring tool.\n",
        "We did this by composing a Python object\n",
        "that contains all relevant components for training a model.\n",
        "While this is not yet a professional-grade implementation\n",
        "it is perfectly functional and code like this\n",
        "could already help you to solve small problems quickly.\n",

        "理论分析：在使用数据迭代器（如 DataLoader ）时，当样本数不能被批量大小整除时，在一个训练轮次（epoch）结束时，最后一个批次的数据量会小于设定的批量大小。例如，有 103 个样本，批量大小设为 32，前 3 个批次是 32 个样本，最后一个批次是 7 个样本。这不会影响模型训练，只是在计算梯度和更新权重时，基于这个小批次进行计算。"
